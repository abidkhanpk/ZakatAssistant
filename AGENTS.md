# Instructions for AI Agents (Must Follow)

This repository is actively used. Your job is to implement only the requested change(s) without breaking existing behavior.

If any instruction here conflicts with a user request, ask for clarification *only if absolutely necessary*. Otherwise, follow these instructions.

---

## 1) Prime Directive: Do No Harm
- Preserve existing features and behavior unless the request explicitly changes them.
- Keep changes minimal, targeted, and reversible.
- Avoid refactors, rewrites, formatting sweeps, dependency upgrades, or “cleanup” that are not required to complete the request.

---

## 2) Scope Control (Strict)
While editing:
- Change only code directly related to the request.
- Do not modify unrelated functions, rename things “for clarity”, or reorganize folders unless explicitly requested.
- Do not “optimize” or “improve architecture” unless asked.

After editing:
- If you touched more files than expected, explain why each was necessary.

---

## 3) Understand Before You Change
- Read the surrounding code and patterns used in the project.
- Follow existing conventions (naming, structure, error handling, logging, style).
- If you are unsure how something works, search within the codebase first (references/usages/tests).

---

## 4) Backwards Compatibility & API Safety
- Do not introduce breaking changes to public interfaces (APIs, exported functions, schemas, routes, config formats) unless requested.
- If an interface must change, update *all* call sites and documentation that depend on it.
- Maintain data compatibility:
  - Avoid destructive migrations.
  - Never drop/rename persisted fields without a safe migration plan.

---

## 5) Testing Requirements (Non-Negotiable)
- Run the existing test suite relevant to the change if possible.
- Add or update tests when you change behavior, fix a bug, or add a feature.
- Keep tests focused on the requested behavior (no broad rework).
- If you cannot run tests (environment limitations), say so and:
  - identify which tests should be run by a human/CI,
  - explain what you changed and what could be risky.

---

## 6) Incremental Changes & Reviewability
- Prefer small, readable diffs over big changes.
- Make one logical change per commit/PR section if possible.
- Avoid mixing refactors with functional changes.
- Keep formatting noise out of diffs.

---

## 7) Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Handle failure modes explicitly (null/undefined, network failures, timeouts, empty states).
- Do not swallow errors silently.
- Maintain existing error conventions (error types, status codes, messages).
- Add guardrails where needed, but only where relevant to the requested change.

---

## 8) Security & Privacy Baselines
- Do not log secrets, tokens, passwords, private keys, or sensitive user data.
- Validate and sanitize untrusted inputs.
- Use parameterized queries / safe ORM patterns (avoid injection).
- Follow existing authz/authn patterns; never bypass security checks for convenience.

---

## 9) Performance (Only When Relevant)
- Don’t micro-optimize or refactor for performance unless requested.
- If the requested change could cause regressions (N+1 queries, extra renders, heavy loops), call it out and mitigate minimally.

---

## 10) Dependencies & Tooling (Be Conservative)
- Do not add new dependencies unless necessary.
- Prefer existing utilities/libraries already used in the repo.
- Do not upgrade framework/runtime versions unless explicitly requested.
- If you add a dependency:
  - explain why it’s necessary,
  - keep it minimal,
  - ensure licensing is compatible (if your org has requirements, follow them).

---

## 11) Frontend/UI Changes (If Applicable)
- Preserve existing UX patterns and component conventions.
- Ensure accessibility basics: labels, focus order, keyboard navigation, ARIA only when needed.
- Avoid visual redesigns unless requested.

---

## 12) Documentation
- Update docs only when the change affects usage, setup, env vars, or public APIs.
- Keep doc edits minimal and accurate.

---

## 13) What You Must Report Back
In your final response, include:
1. **Summary** of what you changed (bullets).
2. **Files changed** and why each was touched.
3. **How to test** (commands and/or steps).
4. **Risks / edge cases** (only if any) and how you mitigated them.

---

## 14) Hard Prohibitions
You MUST NOT:
- change unrelated behavior “while you’re there”
- rename public functions/routes/fields without updating all usages
- remove code you believe is “unused” without proof (search + references + tests)
- disable lint rules/tests to “make it pass”
- commit secrets or credentials
- make sweeping formatting changes
- change lockfiles unless dependencies changed intentionally
- always run build command yourself unless user requested and when you run the build command, cd into project directory before build command so that build version is created in project directory and user don't have run build again to start the app
---

## 15) Default Approach Checklist
Use this workflow:
1. Locate the smallest set of files related to the request.
2. Make the minimal code change.
3. Add/update targeted tests.
4. Run relevant checks/tests.
5. Re-check for unintended changes (diff review).
6. Provide the required report-back details.

---

## 16) Prisma Schema & Migration Rules (Strict)

### Prisma Ownership Rule
- **If Prisma is already scaffolded in the repository, Prisma is the single source of truth for the database schema from this point forward.**
- All schema changes **must be made via `schema.prisma`.**
- **Raw SQL must NOT be used** to modify or evolve the database schema (e.g. `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, etc.) unless explicitly instructed by a human.

### Migration Generation Rule
- **The agent must NOT manually create or edit `migration.sql` files** unless explicitly told to do so.
- Migration files will be generated **only** via Prisma CLI commands (e.g. `prisma migrate dev`) by user himself unless explicitly told to run `prisma migrate dev` command.
- The agent must never attempt to hand-write, reconstruct, or reverse-engineer migrations.

### Allowed Prisma Workflow
- Modify `schema.prisma`
- Generate migrations using Prisma CLI **only when instructed**
- Apply migrations using approved Prisma workflows
- Keep migration history consistent and linear

### Prohibited Actions
- Writing raw SQL for schema evolution when Prisma is present
- Generating `migration.sql` manually
- Bypassing Prisma migrations to “speed things up”
- Run `prisma migrate dev` command unless explicitly told to do so
- Using `prisma db push` as a replacement for migrations unless explicitly instructed

> **Rationale:** Once Prisma is adopted, schema drift caused by raw SQL or hand-written migrations breaks migration history, reproducibility, and production safety.

---
## 17) Versioning Requirement (Strict)

- **If the application displays a version number anywhere** (UI, API response, config, metadata, footer, logs, etc.), that version **MUST be incremented with every commit or modification**.
- Increment the version **for every change**, including small fixes, refactors, or internal updates, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Follow the **existing versioning scheme** used in the project (e.g., Semantic Versioning, build number, revision counter).
- **Do NOT introduce a new versioning format** if one already exists.
- If the version appears in multiple places, **all references MUST be kept in sync**.
- If no version is currently displayed or exposed, **do NOT add one unless explicitly requested**.
